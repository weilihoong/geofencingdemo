# GeofenceDemo

Note:
  - Select location permission to "Allow all the time". Google map needs background location permission.
  - Android Simulator's Location control seems to no able to lock the location after enabling the "Allow all the time" permission, restart app if required.
  
  
## How to use this demo:
1. Long press on the map to set a geofence
2. Route your device to the location
3. The "Geofencing Wi-Fi SSID" text field is for user to a geofence network name, so that if the device is connected to the entered name, it will considered as within geofence area.
4. Geofence status at the bottom will display "Inside" in green color if user is inside geofence, or "Outside" in red color if user is outside of the geofence area
